# Problem Statement
In today’s digital economy, **visual recommendation systems** have become a cornerstone for industries where product appearance significantly influences customer decisions. Sectors such as **clothing and fashion, furniture and home décor, beauty and cosmetics, art and design, and food and beverage** heavily rely on visually-driven recommendations to engage customers and drive sales. Leading **e-commerce** platforms like **Amazon, Flipkart, and Alibaba, fashion retailers like Zara, H&M, and ASOS, and lifestyle platforms like Pinterest and Instagram Shopping** use advanced visual recommendation systems to provide personalized and visually appealing product suggestions.

These systems, powered by **deep neural networks (DNNs)**, analyze images and videos to learn rich visual representations that align product recommendations with user preferences. However, the dependence on deep learning models introduces a significant vulnerability: **adversarial attacks**.

By applying small, imperceptible changes (adversarial perturbations) to product images, malicious actors can manipulate these visual recommendation systems to:

- Promote counterfeit or low-quality products,
- Suppress genuine competitors' products,
- Mislead customers with irrelevant or deceptive product suggestions.
Such vulnerabilities threaten the accuracy, fairness, and trustworthiness of recommendation systems, ultimately damaging the user experience and the platform’s brand reputation.

To address this issue, the researchers propose a novel solution called **Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR)**. This method employs adversarial learning to enhance the system's robustness by training models to resist adversarial perturbations.
